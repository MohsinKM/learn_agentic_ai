# 🧠 Agentic Data Pipeline with CrewAI

This repository contains a **minimal working example** of an agentic data pipeline built using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai). It simulates how multiple AI agents can collaborate on a structured data analysis workflow—without manual handoffs or glue code.

---

## 📊 What Does It Do?

This pipeline includes two agents:

- 🛰️ **Ingestion Agent**: Fetches the Iris dataset  
- 📊 **Visualization Agent**: Generates a scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length

The goal is to demonstrate **agent coordination**, which is a foundational concept for building scalable **Agentic AI systems**.
